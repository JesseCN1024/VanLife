# Tech Stack
**Frontend**
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Routing with hooks like useRoutes, useLoaderData
* Bootstrap - Styling and responsive design
* HTML/CSS - Markup and styling

**Backend**
* mirageJS - API mocking

The core of the frontend is built with React and React Router 6 for routing and navigation. Key React Router hooks like useRoutes, useLoaderData and Link/NavLink, ... are used.

Bootstrap provides responsive design and styling capabilities out of the box.

The backend uses mirageJS to mock APIs and provide fake data for prototyping.
